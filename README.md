Hello. I'm an engineer. I live in [Brighton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton) and work for [Give Directly][gd] a charity that gives cash to people in extreme poverty.

Before that I worked at a small firm in [Lewes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewes) [that helps children's nurseries](http://eyfs.info). Their main product is [Tapestry](https://tapestry.info), an online learning journal.

Before that I was a Deputy Director at the UK [Department of Energy and Climate Change][decc]. I also do occasional freelance work through [Green on Black Ltd][gnb].
